Heartbeat Classification using LSTM Model
Overview
This project aims to classify heartbeat signals into different categories (e.g., normal or abnormal) using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The dataset used contains time-series data representing heartbeat signals, and the model is trained to identify patterns indicative of specific conditions or abnormalities in heart rhythms.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled heartbeat data, typically from sources like ECG readings or preprocessed datasets from platforms like PhysioNet or Kaggle.
